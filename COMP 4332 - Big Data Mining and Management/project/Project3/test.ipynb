       "['we went for a team lunch, such a worst restaurant.. food was tasteless, service was very slow and Ac was not working. We‚Äôve requested them multiple times but its of no use. Please don‚Äôt waste your money and I strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours,',\n",
       " 'Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu.',\n",
       " \"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)\\nBetter ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!\\nI wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà\\nExtensive...\\nAmbience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!\\nFood! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)\\nThe good part! Quantity üòç\\nI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.\\nThe daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(\\nThe breads and raita were decent!\\nThe Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà\\nConclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.\\nWould like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!\",\n",
       " 'Awesome food, very good ambience, centrally located, ample parking....coordination between serving boys / service has scope for improvement, boys very courteous though. Not sure why the bar was closed on a Saturday evening....Overall good experience & extremely value for money....will visit again!',\n",

Very courteous staff and very hospitile.\\nTaste is good but the best part is presentation,,, it's really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant .\\nVery impressed with Mr Ahmed , Pradeep and Mr Dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well. Good job guys keep it up.\",\n",
       " 'Came here for lunch and the food was good and tasty. We tried buffet and all the items in veg and non-veg were tasty.\\n\\nThe ambience and service were also good, and the staff were courteous.\\n\\nshubhamtraveltales.wordpress.com',\n",
       " 'It‚Äôs a worst service experience. Food was OK. They took 45mins to get veg pulav. Never seen a restaurant to take such time. Won‚Äôt visit again.',\n",
       " 'Excellent food and very good service by soumen das..\\nAmbience was good too with live music. Food was served timely. Decor of the restaurant was amazing as well.',\n",
       " 'I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & \"Italian\" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.',\n",
       " 'Staff are just polite and responsive. Food is the best part here. And it is better as ambience also awesome here. I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.']"

      "Must read - I went to this place with my friends for buffet lunch. We had two options for welcome drink - one is pineapple and other is grape which were not natural fruit juices they tasted as preservatives, then moving on to soup - manchow soup was good, waiter forget to give us the starter. Served us after we reminding him, we liked crispy baby corn among 3 varieties of starters which he took 10 mints to serve for the second serve when only 10% of the place was occupied. When I asked him mayo dip waiter was giving us the left over part of dip on the table beside. When I asked for chilled water they were saying they don't have, later one of my friend asked the same person he gave us chilled water. All the items which were placed at buffet were cold not even Luke warm. Biryani was totally dried out rice was sticking to the vessel had lot more bad experience here on same day\n",

      "Simply the best place in town for hosting a party specially if you are looking for a pure vegetarian authentic north Indian food. I hosted a lunch party for about 40 adults and 15 kids today and what a memorable experience we had!! It was an important personal occasion for me and I wanted it to be a memory for lifetime and Lime staff (specially the manager, Dinesh) made sure that it happens just that way!. Food was excellent. Starters were plenty and each one of them was outclassing the other one in taste. My guest just kept asking for more and more and Lime staff kept serving them without any fuss!. I just loved their Ajwaini Paneer tikka, corn Manchurian and cottage cheese pizza. Pain puri and dahi puri were good too. And yes, the delicious manchow soup that we opted instead of tomato soup they offered by default. Main course was also matching with the high expectations that starters set. All curries were great in taste, rotis and naan were served hot and whenever one wants. Rice item were also good (didn't try one myself but as told by my guests). They served Jalebi with rabadi and chocolate gulabjamoon as desserts and everyone just loved them.\n",

      "Would also like to specially mention the courtesy and hospitality shown by each and every member of their serving staff. They were actually requesting my guests to taste everything and were treating my guests and their own! What more I could have asked for. At the end special thanks to Lime manager Dinesh who made sure that we have the experience that we had. I would strongly recommend this place if you want a memory for a very long time.\n",
